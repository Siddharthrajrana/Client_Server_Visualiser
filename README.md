    run : java Server 

    then 
    compile : javac Client.java 
    run : java Client 


Description

The Client Server Visualiser demonstrates the fundamentals of network communication using Java. It establishes a connection between a client and server, allowing them to exchange information over a network. The application utilizes TCP handshake to ensure reliable data transmission.
How It Works

    Server: The server listens for incoming connections from clients. Once a connection is established, it handles the communication process.

    Client: The client initiates the connection with the server. It sends and receives data as required.
